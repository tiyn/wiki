# BitTorrent

[BitTorrent](https://www.bittorrent.org) is a communication protocol for
peer-to-peer file sharing.
In BitTorrent context Leeching describes the process of only downloading a
file, seeding describes the download followed by also uploading it.

## Clients

There are various clients to use for BitTorrent down- and uploading.
The list below shows clients with an existing entry in this wiki.

## Personal Video Recorders

There are a bunch of applications intended as personal video recorders for
usenet or BitTorrent usage.
These include the so called [\*ARR applications](/wiki/*arr.md).
Usually an indexer application like [Jackett](/wiki/jackett.md) is needed.

## Legal Situation

This is not a legal advice.
Take your local laws into account when downloading torrents.
Some torrents can be copyright infringing and therefor illegal to download.
Only download legal and safe torrents like the
[Arch Linux ISO](/wiki/linux/arch-linux.md#create-installation-medium).
Seeding it can help the community.
