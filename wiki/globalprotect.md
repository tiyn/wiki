# GlobalProtect 

[GlobalProtect](https://www.paloaltonetworks.de/resources/datasheets/globalprotect-datasheet) is a
cross-platform [VPN](/wiki/vpn.md).

## Installation

The GlobalProtect client is available for [Windows](/wiki/windows.md), MacOS,
[Linux](/wiki/linux.md), [Android](/wiki/android.md) aswell as iOs and iPadOS.
On some Linux distributions the package is called `globalprotect-openconnect` but the corresponding
command is called `gpclient` which can sometimes lead to confusion.

## Usage 

The usage of the GlobalProtect client is pretty simple.
After starting the program the portal address has to be added and is followed by a login.
Afterwards the client will connect.

GlobalProtect is usually used by bigger companies and universities like the
[University of Oldenburg](https://uol.de/it-services/services/campus-network) which wrote a proper
installation and usage guide for all the operating systems that are supported.
