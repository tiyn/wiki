# Airsonic

[Airsonic](https://github.com/airsonic/airsonic) is a free and open-source
personal media streamer used for [music,podcasts and audiobooks](./audio.md).
It is a fork of [Subsonic](./subsonic.md).
Airsonic is not maintained anymore and therefore deprecated.
A more modern implementation of it is
[Airsonic-Advanced](./airsonic-advanced.md).

## Setup

The software can be setup via [Docker](/wiki/docker.md) with the
[linuxserver image](./docker/linuxserver_-_airsonic.md).

### Clients

It is possible to use many different clients because the server is compatible
with all the Subsonic clients.
These can be found in the [Subsonic entry](./subsonic.md#clients).

Additionally to these clients there is an improved web user interface made by tamland called
[airsonic-refix](https://github.com/tamland/airsonic-refix).
