# E-mail

E-mail is a method of exchanging electronic messages.

## Setup

E-mail usually consists of a [server](#server) and a [client](#client).

## Server

If you want to host your own mail-server there are solutions with and without
interfaces.

- [Dovecot](./docker-images/tvial_-_docker-mailserver.md) is a simple dockerized
  mail server that has no interface.

## Client

If you don't have a built-in web interface for your mail-server you need some
software to access your mails.
And even if you have it can be useful to keep your mails synced locally on your pc.

- [Neomutt](linux/neomutt.md) is a [terminal-based](/wiki/system_console.md)
  mail client for linux, that has a simple interface.
