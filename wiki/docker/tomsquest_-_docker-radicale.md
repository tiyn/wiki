# tomsquest - docker-radicale

This is a [Docker](/wiki/docker.md) container for a [Radicale](/wiki/radicale.md) server.
The official container and documentation was made by
[tomsquest](https://hub.docker.com/r/tomsquest/docker-radicale).

The `latest` tag at the moment of writing this readme was corrupted.
The last usable tag was used therefore to guarantee best performance for all users.

## Set-up

Create the file `rebuild.sh`.
Create a volume with the name `radicale_config`.
Then create the `config` file in the volume `radicale_config`.
Change the settings according to your needs and run `./rebuild.sh` afterwards.

### Volumes

Set the following volumes with the -v tag.

| Outside mount/volume name | Container mount | Description                 |
| ------------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------- |
| `radicale_data`           | `/data`         | storage for caldav          |
| `radicale_config`         | `/config`       | storage for radicale config |

### Ports

Set the following ports with the -p tag.

| Container Port | Recommended outside port | Protocol | Description   |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | -------- | ------------- |
| `5232`         | `5232`                   | TCP      | WebUI, caldav |

### Additional

There are some special variables to set.

| Flag          | Usage                                                                  |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--read-only` | make Radicale read-only, caldav can still be changed and used normally |

### rebuild.sh

```sh
#/bin/sh
docker stop radicale
docker rm radicale
docker pull tomsquest/docker-radicale:2.1.11.4
docker run --name radicale \
    --restart unless-stopped \
    --read-only \
    -p 5232:5232 \
    -v radicale_data:/data \
    -v radicale_config:/config \
    -d tomsquest/docker-radicale:2.1.11.4
```

Following this you need to make sure there is a password file in the docker
volume `radicale_data` called `users`.
The password will be encrypted using `bcrypt`.
Steps to create a file with a user and password:

- You will have to install the package which includes `htpasswd`; for debian
  based distributions this is `apt install apache2-utils`
- `cd /var/lib/docker/volumes/radicale\_data/\_data` - go to the volume
- `touch ./users` - create a file called users
- `htpasswd -B ./users username` - add user with name and password to the file
  (change `username` to your desired username)

Now you can go to the exposed port and login with your chosen username and password.
If you only added one user you shouldn't be able to login with any other data
than your username and password.
