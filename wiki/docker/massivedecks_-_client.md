# massivedecks - client

This is a [Docker](/wiki/docker.md) container for a [Massive Deecks](/wiki/game/massive_decks.md)
client.
Due to ease of use this entry will also feature the server container.
The official container and documentation was made by
[Lattyware](https://github.com/Lattyware/massivedecks).
This docker-rebuild is made up by a `docker-compose.yml` file.
In addition to the client and server containers a [postgres container](/wiki/docker/postgres.md)
needs to be connected.

## Set-up

Create the files `rebuild.sh`, `.env` and `docker-compose.yml` at the same
place.
Make sure to set `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`.
Change the settings according to your needs and run `./rebuild.sh` afterwards.

### Ports

Set the following ports in the `ports:` section.

| Container Port | Recommended outside port | Protocol | Description |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | -------- | ----------- |
| `8080`         | `8080`                   | TCP      | WebUI       |

### Environment-variables

Set the following environment-variables in the `environment:` section of the
docker-compose file.

| Name        | Usage                   | Default           |
