# VPN

A VPN is a virtual private network.
It uses a secure connection between a computer and a network or two networks.
It can be used to display another [IP address](/wiki/ip_address.md) but does not make tracking or
fingerprinting of the device impossible.
For the latter a plugin like [Chameleon](/wiki/chameleon.md) for [Firefox](/wiki/firefox.md)
can be used.
VPNs feature a server and a client side.
