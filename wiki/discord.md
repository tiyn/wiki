# Discord

[Discord](https://discord.com/) is an social platform that combines voice and video conferences as
well as instant messaging chats.

## Usage

This section addresses various features of Discord.

### Disable Automatic Update Checks

By default Discord performs an automatic check to see if it is up to date.
On [Linux](/wiki/linux.md)-based systems it can be disabled by adding `"SKIP_HOST_UPDATE": true` to
the `~/.config/discord/settings.json` file.

### Setting Up a Music Bot

For Discord there are various bots capable of playing music.
The following is a list of bots featured in this wiki that can do this.

- [Sinusbot](/wiki/sinusbot.md) is a self-hosted bot for Discord that can play music and sounds. 
  It's closed-source and free of charge.
  It also features [Teamspeak](/wiki/teamspeak.md) support.

### Themes and Plugins
