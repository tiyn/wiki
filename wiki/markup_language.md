# Markup Language

A markup Language is way to encode text so that it has great amounts of structure and formatting.
The most common markup languages are [HTML](#html), Markdown, [LaTeX](#latex) and [XML](#xml).
Markup languages can be used for [note-taking](/wiki/note-taking.md).
Adding to normal markdown files, there are also `.mdx` files which allows the usage of JavaScripts
JSX in the markdown content for displaying charts and more.

## Grammar Checking

An often used grammar and spell checking tool that supports many markup languages is
[LTeX](/wiki/ltex.md).

## Different languages

This section addresses various markup languages and their usages.

### HTML

HTML is a markup language that is mostly used in the internet via the hypertext system and accessed
via [web browsers](/wiki/web_browser.md).
For styling HTML accordingly CSS is used most of the time.
HTML can be quite challenging to write, read and check for validity.
An easy way to do the latter one is a validation service.
One of the most used ones is the
[Markup Validation Service by W3C](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input).

### XML

XML is a markup language often used together with [RSS Feeds](/wiki/rss.md).

### LaTeX

LaTeX provides a high-level, descriptive markup language.
It is mostly used in the scientific community but can be used for many things and as an alternative
to [Microsoft Word](/wiki/office_suite.md#programs).

LaTeX also features many different packages.
The following list contains some examples of it.

- [ZUGFeRD](https://ctan.org/pkg/zugferd) is a package for creating invoices.
- [Awesome-CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) is a package for creating job applications.
