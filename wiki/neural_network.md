# Neural Network

A neural network - often shortened to NN - is a computational model which is part of so called
artificial intelligence.

## Useful Tools

There are some useful tools to use with neural networks.

- [Netron](https://github.com/lutzroeder/netron) is a open-source and self-hostable tool to
  visualize neural networks.
  It is also easily available from the [official website](https://netron.app/).

## Frameworks

The following is a list of frameworks to design or run neural networks.

- [PyTorch](/wiki/programming_language/python.md#pytorch)
- [Tensorflow](/wiki/programming_language/python.md#tensorflow)

## Neural Network Accelerators

Neural network accelerators are devices to run neural networks by inference.
The following is a list of possible devices.

- [Raspberry Pi AI Hat+](/wiki/linux/raspberry_pi.md#ai-hat) is a standalone accelerator which
  directly attaches to a [Raspberry Pi](/wiki/linux/raspberry_pi.md) via the GPIO header.
- [ESP32S3](/wiki/microcontroller.md#esp32) is a self-contained microcontroller by Seeed with
  integrated AI acceleration.
  It does not need an external connection and is especially useful when a small form-factor is
  needed.
- Google Coral Edge TPU is a USB-connected accelerator that is not embedded in the host system.
