# Waydroid

[Waydroid](https://waydo.id) is a container-based approach to boot a full
[Android system](/wiki/android.md) on a regular [Linux system](/wiki/linux.md)

## Setup

On most [Linux distributions](/wiki/linux.md) Waydroid can be installed with the `waydroid`
package.

After setting up the system has to be initialized.
When running `waydroid status` it will also tell, if initialization is needed.

The initialization can easily be done by running the following command.

```sh 
waydroid init
```
