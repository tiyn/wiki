# Package Managers

Package managers are important programs to get software onto your system.

The following is a list of package managers and the corresponding [Linux](/wiki/linux.md)
distributions.

- [Debian](/wiki/linux/debian.md) and Debian-based distributions like
  [Proxmox](/wiki/linux/proxmox.md) use the [APT](/wiki/linux/package_manager/apt.md) package
  manager.
- [Arch Linux](/wiki/linux/arch-linux.md) and Arch-based distributions use
  [Pacman]() and various managers for the AUR.
