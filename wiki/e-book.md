# E-book

An E-book is a digital publication of a book.
They can be read with specific hardware - an e-reader - or on a personal
computer.
E-books are usually available in `.epub` or `.pdf` files.
Amazon (`.azw`), Mobi (`.mobi`) and other brands selling e-readers have
proprietary formats.

## Management

The management of e-books can be achieved by using special software suites like
[calibre](/wiki/calibre.md).

## DRM

Proprietary formats may but don't have to feature DRM.
There are some software solutions for handling DRM like the no longer supported
[DeDRM by apprenticeharper](https://github.com/apprenticeharper/DeDRM_tools) or
its supported counterpart [DeDRM by noDRM](https://github.com/noDRM/DeDRM_tools).
Due to legal issues in many places it is recommended to not use these or
similar software.
If the software is to be used by you check your local laws first.

## Tracking

Many e-book readers include a feature to keep track of read books.
However they do not track the time that was needed to finish them or the number of e-books read in 
a specific timeframe.
This can be done by using a special tracker like [Jelu](/wiki/jelu.md) which can be used to keep
track of e-books and normal books at the same time which is a feature no e-book reader has.
