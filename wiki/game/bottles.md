# Bottles

[Bottles](https://usebottles.com/) is an application similar to
[Lutris](/wiki/game/lutris.md) that focusses on running both
[Windows](/wiki/windows.md) applications aswell as [games](/wiki/game.md) through
[WINE](/wiki/linux/wine.md) or their own runner [Caffe](#caffe).

## Caffe

[Caffe](https://docs.usebottles.com/components/runners) is the official runner
of [Windows](/wiki/windows.md) programs in Bottles.
It is a patched version of [WINE](/wiki/linux/wine.md) that can have positive
effects on certain programs.
