## Add-ons

Guild Wars 2 features a large add-on community.
All add-ons described in this guide will assume
[gw2-add-on-loader](#gw2-add-on-loader) is already installed.
It has to be set up first if not already done.
Additionally this guide assumes the usage of DX11 rendering which is enabled by
default.
Many of the following add-ons are on the
[Approved-Addons list by gw2-addon-loader](https://github.com/gw2-addon-loader/Approved-Addons).

The following subsections assume that Guild Wars 2 is installed at
`gw2_root_directory`.
Replace this directory placeholder according to your installation.
Updating of the add-ons is done by downloading newer versions of the mentioned
files and replacing the old ones at the corresponding locations.

### gw2-add-on-loader

To make multiple add-ons work together an add-on loader is recommended.
One option for this is
[gw2-add-on-loader](https://github.com/gw2-addon-loader/loader-core).

Download the current version from the
[releases page](https://github.com/gw2-addon-loader/loader-core/releases).
Proceed to place the files and folders from the `.zip` archive into the root
directory of guild wars 2.

This add-on loader is capable of loading both DX9 and DX11 add-ons.
This functionality can be added with [d3d9_wrapper](#d3d9wrapper).
The installation of it is therefore recommended.

This add-on does not need to be updated often.
It only is required when Guild Wars 2 switches its API.

### d3d9_wrapper

[d3d9_wrapper](https://github.com/gw2-addon-loader/d3d9_wrapper) is a wrapper
to the d3d9 API that includes d3d9 loading.

arcdps' font can be easily changed.
For this a `.ttf` file is needed.
By moving and renaming the file to `gw2_root_directory/addons/arcdps/arcdps_font.ttf` the new font
will be enabled following the next start of Guild Wars 2.
A font similar to the default Guild Wars 2 font is Lato.
