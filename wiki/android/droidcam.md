# DroidCam

[DroidCam](https://www.dev47apps.com/) is an App developed and published
by Dev47Apps for [Android](/wiki/android.md) systems.
It enables a [smartphone](/wiki/smart_device.md) to be used as [webcam](/wiki/webcam.md).

## Setup

DroidCam needs to be set up on the phone aswell as on the computer to be used.

On [Android](/wiki/android.md) DroidCam is available on the
[Google Play Store](/wiki/android.md#app-store) in a package called
[DroidCam Webcam](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dev47apps.droidcam).

On the computer setup files for both [Linux](/wiki/linux.md) and [Windows](/wiki/windows.md) can be
found on the [official website](https://www.dev47apps.com/).
Alternatively most [Linux systems](/wiki/linux/package_manager.md) feature a package named
`droidcam`.

## Usage

To initiate a connection between the [smartphone](/wiki/smart_device.md) and the computer first
start the app on the smartphone.
Make sure to be connected to the same W-LAN as the computer or alternatively connect them with an
USB-cable.
After starting the application an IP and a port will be displayed.
These have to be pasted into the form that is shown on the computer after starting the corresponding
program.
After pressing `Connect` the link will be established.
The [video feed](/wiki/webcam.md) can then be used in other programs such as Discord or
[Matrix](/wiki/matrix.md).
Additionally it can be piped into [OBS](/wiki/obs.md) to edit it more or create a scene.
Despite the option the separate app [DroidCam OBS](https://www.dev47apps.com/obs/) is not
necessarily needed.
