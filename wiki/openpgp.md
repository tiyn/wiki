[OpenPGP](https://www.openpgp.org/) is the most widely used encryption standard proposed in from
[RFC 4880](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4880).

## Setup

There are different implementations of OpenPGP.
Many [Linux](/wiki/linux.md) [package managers](/wiki/linux/package_manager.md) 
package the implementation called [Gnu Privacy Guard](/wiki/linux/gpg.md) in the `gnupg` or
sometimes also `gpg` or `gpg2` package.
