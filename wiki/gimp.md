# GIMP

[GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) is a popular cross-platform program for editing pictures.

## Setup

The GIMP program can be installed from files found on
[the official website](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/).
Alternatively many [Linux](/wiki/linux.md) [package managers](/wiki/linux/package_manager.md) 
package GIMP in the `gimp` package.

## Usage

### Scale Image

An image that is already loaded into GIMP can easily be scaled down (or up) by selecting
`Scale Image` under the `Image` tab.
Alternatively the scale tool reachable via `Ctrl+S` can be used.
