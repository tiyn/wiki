# Multi-Factor Authentication

Multi-factor authentication - most often two-factor authentication or 2FA - is an electronic
authentication method that consists of having additional authentication mechanisms to the standard
way which is most often a password.

## Using the Smartphone as an Authentication Device

Using Smartphones or other [smart devices](/wiki/smart_device.md) is an easy way to set up
multi-factor authentication because it is a device most people carry with them day by day.
For setting it up refer to the
[corresponding section of the Android entry](/wiki/android.md#multi-factor-authentication).
