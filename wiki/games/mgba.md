### Start Emulated Game in Fullscreen Mode

In different scenarios it can be useful to start directly into a game in fullscreen mode.
One example would be using the [Steam Deck](/wiki/games/steam_deck.md) to 
[set up a game in the Steam UI](/wiki/games/steam_deck.md#running-a-game-directly-through-the-interface) 
so it can be run directly without switching to the desktop mode.
For this add the `-f` flag for fullscreen mode.
