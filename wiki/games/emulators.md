# Emulators

An Emulator is a hard- or software that enables a computer to behave like
another computer.
In the gaming context this is mainly used to run games from a console on
another computer.
Emulators usually need ROMs to run games.
ROMs are a digital copy of a video game.
Please note that downloading ROMs of licensed games is not permitted due to copyright.
All [emulators](#list-of-emulator-software) should only use non copyright infringing ROMs.

Due to its form factor emulators can be installed and used nicely on a
[Steam Deck](/wiki/games/steam_deck.md).
Emulator games can even be
[started through the normal interface](/wiki/games/steam_deck.md#running-a-game-directly-through-the-interface).
